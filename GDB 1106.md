##GDB Enrichment Tutorial##

It won't be tested on final exam, but it is extreme useful, and it's compulsory for OS

-----------

GDB lets you

- Pause/Stop through your program
- Inspect + change memory

compile with `-g`

	g++14 prog.cc -g -o prog
	gdb ./prog

commands

	command			| Description
	----------------|---------------
	run  [args]		| starts prog with [args] as command line args
	Ctrl +C			| pause prog + return control to us (at random point)
	backtrace		| Gives your a stack trace
	up				| look at next function in call stack
	down			| look at previous function in call stack
	kill 			| Ends the program
	print [expr]	| Evaluate + print [expr]
	break [fn]		| Pause prog when fn is called
	breake file:line| Stop whenever file:line is reached
	next			| run one line of prog
	display	[expr]	| call print [expr] wherever prog pause
	??(TA forget it)| change variable value during running

	break reverse
	run myfile.txt
	// prog stop at reverse function

bookstock.cc


	quit 			| quit
	watch [var]		| Pause prog whenever the memory of var change
